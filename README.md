## Usage

Please refer to the AWS published [Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) for up-to-date guidance on AWS best practices.

### Organization Layer

Creates AWS Organizations management, Identity Center (SSO), and S3 backend for Terraform state. Module instantiation is once per organization.

```hcl
module "organization" {
  source = "gocloudLa/standard-platform/aws//modules/organization"

  metadata = local.metadata

  organization_parameters = {
    # Organization configuration
  }

  identity_center_parameters = {
    # Identity Center configuration
  }

  s3_backend_parameters = {
    # S3 Backend configuration
  }
}
```

### Base Layer

Creates foundational networking infrastructure including VPC, Route53 zones, CloudMap service discovery, and SNS notifications.

```hcl
module "base" {
  source = "gocloudLa/standard-platform/aws//modules/base"

  metadata = local.metadata

  vpc_parameters = {
    # VPC configuration
  }

  route53_parameters = {
    # Route53 zones configuration
  }

  cloudmap_parameters = {
    # CloudMap service discovery configuration
  }

  notifications_parameters = {
    # SNS notifications configuration
  }
}
```

### Foundation Layer

Creates security, compliance, backup, and operational services including ACM certificates, GitLab Runner, AWS Backup, SES, VPN, WAF, and monitoring.

```hcl
module "foundation" {
  source = "gocloudLa/standard-platform/aws//modules/foundation"

  metadata = local.metadata

  acm_parameters = {
    # ACM certificate configuration
  }

  gitlab_runner_parameters = {
    # GitLab Runner configuration
  }

  aws_backup_parameters = {
    # AWS Backup configuration
  }

  # ... other foundation parameters
}
```

### Project Layer

Creates core infrastructure services including load balancers, compute clusters, databases, storage, and messaging services.

```hcl
module "project" {
  source = "gocloudLa/standard-platform/aws//modules/project"

  metadata = local.metadata

  alb_parameters = {
    # Application Load Balancer configuration
  }

  ecs_parameters = {
    # ECS cluster configuration
  }

  rds_parameters = {
    # RDS database configuration
  }

  # ... other project parameters
}
```

### Workload Layer

Creates application-level services including static websites, containerized applications, serverless functions, and batch processing jobs.

```hcl
module "workload" {
  source = "gocloudLa/standard-platform/aws//modules/workload"

  metadata = local.metadata

  static_site_parameters = {
    # Static website configuration
  }

  ecs_service_parameters = {
    # ECS service configuration
  }

  lambda_parameters = {
    # Lambda function configuration
  }

  # ... other workload parameters
}
```
