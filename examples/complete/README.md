# Complete Example

This example demonstrates a comprehensive setup of the entire AWS Standard Platform with all five layers (Organization, Base, Foundation, Project, and Workload) configured together using Terraform. **This example is designed ONLY for testing and validation purposes - it is NOT how the module should be used in production.**

## üîß What's Included

### Analysis of Terraform Configuration

#### Main Purpose
The main purpose is to provide a complete testing and validation template that demonstrates the integration of all five layers of the AWS Standard Platform to ensure proper module functionality and dependencies.

#### Key Features Demonstrated
- **Complete Platform Integration**: All five layers (Organization, Base, Foundation, Project, Workload) deployed together
- **Layer Dependencies**: Demonstrates proper dependency management between layers
- **End-to-End Testing**: Validates the complete platform functionality
- **Integration Validation**: Tests the interaction between all platform components
- **Testing Purpose**: This example is designed for testing and validation, not production deployment
- **Module Validation**: Ensures all modules work correctly when integrated together

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
